					      <div class="modal-body">
					        <p class="modalpara">In college, despite my double specializations in product development and financial planning, I also had double minors in Economic and French. My passion and my capacity to learn were also recognized at work. I have done five internships from 2011-2013 while obtaining my college degree because I valued hands on experience and understand the importance of real-world working experience.</p>
							<p>In regards to learning code, I have been using different online resources to teach myself code. My curiosity to new technologies always push me out of my comfort zone. Even though I may not understand certain concepts at the very first time, I would keep searching materials online and learn from reading or watching tutorials. You can find a list of resources I used to learn code <a href="https://mandylearnscode.wordpress.com/coding-resources/">here</a> since my coding journey began in October. I understand this industry is constantly evolving and new technologies are put out there everyday. One must stay hungry and foolish to learn for a lifetime as a developer. I am committed to make the change and become a self-reliant developer.</p>
							<p>After my first exposure to programming through attending <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/">WomenWhoCode</a> HTML and CSS workshop in April 2015, I have been looking for different local resources or events such as WomenWhoCode monthly algorithms meetup or their weekly front-end study group to meet people who shared same interest with me and to further develop my programming skills. I would finish my daytime work and went to the evening study groups consistently. To concloude, I looked for every single opportunity to learn more about programming via different channels.</p>

					        <p>Growing up as a kid, I saw how hard my parents worked to support the family. They are my role models. As the second generation of the chinese immigrants, I managed to enroll as a full-time student in New York City meanwhile working at JP Morgan Chase and interned at different corporate retail companies. I graduated with 3.5 GPA and had five internships under my belt which highly boosted my value to the employers.</p>
					        <p>After I graduated from college, I worked as a retail planning analyst. Every day I worked from 7am to 7pm sometimes until 8pm depends on the season. Since my work invloved a lot of reports analysis, bringing work to home for the weekend are nothing new in the industry.</p>
					        <p>In November 2015, I attended my first Hackathon at University of Maryland. During the two days Hackathon, we were challenged to pitch an idea and built a demo within 24 hours. I stayed up all night to work on the front end side of the project. Our creativity and innovative UI/UX Design, helped us stand out from 20 plus groups of hackers and win the champion of JP Morgan Chase Challenge.

						        <p>During the month of December, I would get up at 7am every day and followed through my study schedule strictly on what to learn and achieve each day. Even on Christmas Day and at New Year Eve, I stayed at home and continued to work on my projects. Here is a <a href="https://mandylearnscode.wordpress.com/projects/">link</a> to all the projects I built during the Christmas holiday. I am a very self-disciplined person that when I set up a goal, I do not and never give up. My goal right now is to become a fullstack JavaScript Developer. Nothing will stop me and there is no turning back for me.</p>
						        <p>I understand programming is not easy and there will be many frustrating moments along the way when I get stuck at different problems. However, my experience as an international student back in 2008 taught me everything is possible as long as I am determined and put enough time and effort into it. I was able to land my first job as a retail planning analyst because of my solid work experience. Although English is my second language, I overcame the language barrier and worked my way through different obstacles. I have come a long way to get to where I am today. Leaving retail industry to the technology world is exciting for me and I will do everything i can to get better at programming.</p>
						        <p>I believe I can learn programming just like I learned English starting from scratch. I believe I can be a great developer. I want to build applications that improve people's life. I hope to inspire other women that they are capable to become developers too. My long term goal is to work for a company that makes a positive impact on the world.</p>

			<h1 class="center title">Why Coding House For Me</h1>
			<p class="lead center">There are Four major reasons</p>
			<ol class="why">
			   </br />
				<li>I want a <u>fully-immersive live in bootcamp</u>. So I can dedicate all my time focus on learning code without worrying about commuting and other daily errands. My goal to get in a bootcamp is to learn as much as possible while every single minute I'm in it. Coding House is the only live in bootcamp I know and it allows me to maximize the use of my time.</li>
				<br />
				<li><u>Small class size and dedicated mentors</u> are another reasons why I think Coding House is for me. While I have been learning programming through self-study, I know the immersion of Coding House will enable me to learn much more quickly. Here is a <a href="https://mandylearnscode.wordpress.com"><strong>link</strong></a> to my blog. I want to learn in a more structural way instead of browsing through different websites.</li>
				<br />
				<li><u>Coding House's 90% JavaScript and 10% HTML curriculum</u> is exactly what I am looking for when applying for a bootcamp. JavaScript is the first programming language I learned and I am sticking with it. JavaScript is the only computer language that allows developers to build a full-fledged web application through a single language.</li>
				<br />
				<li>It is <u>located in the world renowned tech hub, Silicon Valley</u>. Students will gain exposure to the local tech community and connections with various companies through attending different events or hackathons. I would be happy to expand my professional network from New York City to Silicon Valley. I am flexible to relocate to wherever the opportities are. Coding House's live in 12 weeks program is where I will go for.</li>

				<br />
				<li>As a <strong>WomenWhoCode</strong> member, I actively attended different tech events in NYC.
				<br />
				 I hope to share my passion to code with other women and inspire more women to learn programming. I will give back and share my knowledge with other women once I finish Coding House's 12 weeks program. I will volunteer on my free time and attend local WomenWhoCode's event to inspire more women learn programming.
				 <br /> 
				 <br />
				    <p>Below is a link to various events that I participated in 2015 to encourage more women to code.</p>
