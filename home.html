					      <div class="modal-body">
					        <p class="modalpara">While attending college, in addition to having a double specialization in product development and financial planning, I also pursued double minors in Economic and French. My passion and my capacity to learn were often recognized at work. While obtaining my college degree, I did five internships because I valued hands on experience and understand the importance of real-world working experience.</p>
							<p>With regards to learning code, I use various online resources to teach myself code. My curiosity of new technologies always pushes me out of my comfort zone. Even though I may not understand certain concepts the very first time, I keep searching for materials online and learn from reading and watching tutorials. You can find a list of the resources I have used since my coding journey began in October <a href="https://mandylearnscode.wordpress.com/coding-resources/">here</a>. I understand that this industry is constantly evolving and new technologies are expelled every day. One must stay hungry and foolish to learn for a lifetime as a developer. I am committed to make the change and become a self-reliant developer.</p>
							<p>After my first exposure to programming through attending <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/">WomenWhoCode</a> HTML and CSS workshop in April 2015, I always look for local resources and events like WomenWhoCode monthly algorithms meetup and their weekly front-end study group in order to meet people who share similar interests and to further develop my programming skills. I attended the evening study groups consistently although my work schedule was full. To conclude, I look for every single opportunity to learn more about programming via different channels. I constantly look for ways to improve my skills.</p>

					        <p>Growing up as the eldest child in a working class family, I saw how hard working my parents were to support the family. They are my role models. As a second generation of Chinese immigrants, I managed to enroll as a full-time student in New York City while also working at JP Morgan Chase. In addition, I interned at different corporate retail companies. I graduated with 3.5 GPA and had five internships under my belt which highly boosted my value to my employers.</p>
					        <p>After graduating from college, I worked as a retail planning analyst. Every day I worked from 7am to 7pm and sometimes later depending on the season. Because my work involved a lot of report analysis, bringing work home for the weekend was almost a requirement in the industry.</p>
					        <p>In November 2015, I attended my first Hackathon at University of Maryland. During the two-day Hackathon, our challenge was to pitch an idea and build a demo within 24 hours. I stayed up all night to work on the front end side of the project. Our creativity and innovative UI/UX Design, helped us stand out from 20 plus groups of hackers and won the JP Morgan Chase Challenge.

						        <p>During the month of December, I would get up at 7am every day and strictly followed through with my study schedule on what to learn and achieve each day. Even on Christmas Day and at New Year’s Eve I stayed at home and continued to work on my projects. Here is a <a href="https://mandylearnscode.wordpress.com/projects/">link</a> to all the projects I built during the Christmas holiday. I am very self-disciplined and when I set up a goal, I never give up on it. My goal right now is to become a fullstack JavaScript Developer. Nothing will stop me and there is no turning back for me.</p>
						        <p>I understand programming is not easy and there will be many challenging moments along the way, especially when I get stuck on a problem. However, my experience as an international student back in 2008 taught me everything is possible as long as I am determined and put enough time and effort into it. I was able to land my first job as a retail planning analyst because of my solid work experience. Although English is my second language, I worked my way through different obstacles and I overcame the language barrier. I have come a long way to get to where I am today. Leaving the retail industry for the technology world is exciting for me and I will do everything in my power to excel in programming.</p>
						        <p>I believe that I can learn programming just like I learned English from scratch. I believe I can be a great developer. I want to build applications that improve people's life. I hope to inspire other women to become developers too. My long term goal is to work for a company that makes a positive impact on the world.</p>

			<h1 class="center title">Why Coding House For Me</h1>
			<p class="lead center">There are Four major reasons</p>
			<ol class="why">
			   </br />
				<li>I want a <u>fully-immersive live in bootcamp</u>. So I can dedicate all my time focus on learning code without worrying about commuting and other daily errands. My goal during the bootcamp program is to learn as much as possible. Coding House is the only live in bootcamp I know and it allows me to maximize the use of my time.</li>
				<br />
				<li><u>Coding House's 90% JavaScript and 10% HTML curriculum</u> is exactly what I am looking for when applying for a bootcamp. JavaScript is the first programming language I learned and I am sticking with it. JavaScript is the only computer language that allows developers to build a full-fledged web application through a single language.</li>
				<br />
				<li><u>Small class size and dedicated mentors</u> are other reasons why I think Coding House is for me. While I have been learning programming through self-study, I know the immersion of Coding House will enable me to learn much more quickly. Here is a <a href="https://mandylearnscode.wordpress.com"><strong>link</strong></a> to my blog. Instead of browsing through different websites and watching online tutorials randomly, I want to learn in a more structured way. Also, as I was doing the Coding House pre-work, I really appreciate the feedback I received from Coding House's instructors. I can tell Coding House truly care about each student and want them to succeed. Thank you!</li>
				<br />
				<li>It is <u>located in the world renowned tech hub, Silicon Valley</u>, students will gain exposure to the local tech community and connections with various companies through attending different events or hackathons. I would be happy to expand my professional network from New York City to Silicon Valley. I am willing to relocate to wherever the opportities exist.</li>

				<br />
				<p>As a <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/"><strong>WomenWhoCode</strong></a> member, I actively attended different tech events in NYC.
				<p>I hope to share my passion to code with other women and inspire them to learn programming. I will give back and share my knowledge with other women once I finish Coding House's 14 weeks program. I will volunteer on my free time and help other women by attending local WomenWhoCode's events. Just like the volunteers from WomenWhoCode, I hope to be a part of the community to give back, to support and to empower women in tech.</p>
				 <br />
				    <p>Below is a link of events that I have participated in 2015 to meet other women who code, followed by links to more of my work.</p> <a href="https://mandylearnscode.wordpress.com/events/"> https://mandylearnscode.wordpress.com/events/ </a>
